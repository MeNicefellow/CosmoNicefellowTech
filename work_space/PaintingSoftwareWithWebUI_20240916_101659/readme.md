# Painting Software with Web UI

## Overview
This project is a simple painting application that runs in the web browser. It provides users with the ability to draw on a canvas using different brush colors, adjust the brush size, and erase their artwork. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Choose a brush color using a color picker.
- Adjust the size of the brush using a range slider.
- Toggle between drawing and erasing modes with a button.

## File Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the UI components.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the web application.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the painting functionality.

## Getting Started
To run the painting software:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Start painting by selecting a color and adjusting the brush size.

## File Descriptions
- **index.html**: This is the main entry point of the application. It contains the toolbar for selecting colors, adjusting brush size, and the canvas for painting.

- **styles.css**: This file contains CSS rules that style the toolbar and canvas, ensuring a simple and clean user interface.

- **script.js**: This script handles all the painting logic, including mouse events for drawing, changing brush color and size, and toggling the eraser.

## How to Use
1. Use the color picker to select your desired brush color.
2. Use the range slider to change the brush size.
3. Click the 'Eraser' button to toggle between normal drawing and erasing mode.
