# Cosmo Nicefellow Tech

Cosmo Nicefellow Tech is an innovative agent system that simulates a software development company. Inspired by the concept of multi-agent collaboration, our system brings together various AI agents to create a virtual software development environment.

## üåü Overview

Cosmo Nicefellow Tech leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to create a collaborative, AI-driven software development process. Our system is designed to be:

- **Easy to use**: Simple setup and intuitive interface
- **Highly customizable**: Adapt the system to your specific needs
- **Extendable**: Build upon and enhance the core functionality

## ü§ñ Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Various AI agents work together, each with a specific role in the software development process.
- **Natural Language Input**: Describe your software idea in plain language, and watch as our agents bring it to life.
- **Simulated Development Lifecycle**: Experience a complete software development cycle, from ideation to testing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MeNicefellow/CosmoNicefellowTech
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your API key:

   Put your OpenAI API key in a file called .openai_api_key in your home directory.

4. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py --project "Your project description"
   ```

5. To run the Streamlit based web UI:
   ```
   streamlit run main_webui.py
   ```

6. The product will be written in the workspace directory.

   **Note**: The workspace directory will contain both the generated project files and some example projects created by the system. You can explore these examples to see how Cosmo Nicefellow Tech works with different project types.

## Security Considerations

- The system executes Python code and shell commands. Ensure proper security measures are in place when deploying in a production environment.
- Implement additional validation and sanitization for user inputs and LLM outputs to prevent potential security risks.
